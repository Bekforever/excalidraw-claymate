# excalidraw-claymate

## What is this

This is an experimental tool to create clay animations with
[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com).

## How to use it

If you are already familiar with Excalidraw,
just visit <https://dai-shi.github.io/excalidraw-claymate>
and you can do the same.
Only the difference is the bottom area, where you can
add snapshots and export them as animated GIF.

Notes:
- The snapshot size is limited to the size of the first snapshot.
- Currently, there's no way to configure animation speed (help wanted!)
